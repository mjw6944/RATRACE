# 🐀 RATRACE 🛣️
> Stuck in the RATRACE, trying to break free...

## Overview

**RATRACE** is a my fragile attempt at reviving and almagamating several pervious tools I have worked on both in academaia and work. It is a suite of tools consisting of a C2 Server (RATRACE) and implants which can be operated via a PWNLIB-powered pseudo-gui that means most of the functionality of the server can be performed with an up, down, and enter key. 

It’s designed to:
- Encompase the feel of hacker-culture centric tools
- Be increadibly easy to operate, requiring little to no prior knowledge or commands to operate
- Be *fun* to use

---

## Features

- 🐭 **Easy To Use Interface** — The main C2 displays all possible options at any given time, making operating the server as easy as reading plain english
- 📋 **Copybarav2** — The first implant, capable of self-deploying persistence on windows (EXE version included!) or linux. Enables wacky effects on victims like blocking popups and clipboard blockage!   
- ❤️‍🔥 **Splash Art** — I like splash art, so you bet every dang thing I add here will have some.  
- 🌩️ **Send to All** — Need to pwn alot of people quickly? Send a command to every system, or just to windows or linux! A bit more advanced than 1:1 control, but a huge timesaver!

## 🏴‍☠️ DISCLAIMER 🏴‍☠️
RATRACE contains *malware* designed to *compromise system integrity.* Any use is strictly for educational purposes (like red v blue comps!). Running implants on any non-vm device is a **SECURITY RISK,** these implants are designed to be resiliant to novice removal attempts. *Don't get in over your head, use VMs, never hack something you don't own without written permission*  

---

## Installation
*For reasons unknown this doesn't run on windows, never hack naked, use a VM*
**Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mjw6944/RATRACE.git
cd RATRACE
python3 pip install pwnlib
python3 main.py
```
Implants have their own special setups, later I will include ansible scripts which can be configured to auto-deploy implants 

## File Structure
pretend this is here

## For Blue Team:
If you're here because you found an implant: *congrats!* I hope you're having fun!

What? You want the implant removed?

Email me at mjw6944@rit.edu and maybe I can drop you a hint... 🪤🐀
